# Bank Customer Churn Prediction 🚀  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank).  
I experimented with multiple classification algorithms and compared their performance to understand which model works best.  
👉 Business Impact: Helps banks identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python | Pandas | Numpy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Models Used  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest (**Best Performing Model ✅**)  

---

## 📊 Results  
- **Accuracy:** 71%  
- **Recall (Churn):** 86%  
> Recall was prioritized because identifying churn customers is more important than overall accuracy.

## 🧠 Key Learnings  
- How different algorithms behave on the same dataset  
- Handling imbalanced data using `class_weight`  
- Comparing models using proper evaluation metrics
